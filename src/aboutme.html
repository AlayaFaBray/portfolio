                        <p class="self-intro-item-description">Growing up, I very sterotypically longed on becoming a Racecar driver and Astronaut.
                            Though reality hit alongside puberty and I found a deep interest in Design and Programming.
                            Although, it hasn't been until my recent perspective shift that I began pursuing programming, as I shared in the daunt that is commonly felt towards it.

                        <p class="self-intro-item-description">The vast majority of my interests lie within the cache of motorsports. The sport itself, yes, though also the engineering behind it all.
                            Outside that scope, a more recent interest is Astrophysics and all things relating. Fundamentally, all my interests are born from the amazement of the capability of the human brain.
