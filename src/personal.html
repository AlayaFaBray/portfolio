                    <p>As you now know, my name is Alaya. I am 25yrs old and currently located in Brisbane, Australia. Growing up, I very sterotypically longed on becoming a Racecar driver and Astronaut.
                    Though reality hit alongside puberty and I found a deep interest in Design and Programming.
                    Although, it hasn't been until my recent perspective shift that I began pursuing programming, as I shared in the daunt that is commonly felt towards it.

                <h2 class="self-intro-personal-interests">Personal Interests</h2>
                    <p>The vast majority of my interests lie within the cache of motorsports. The sport itself, yes, though also the engineering behind it all.
                    Outside that scope, a more recent interest is Astrophysics and all things relating. Fundamentally, all my interests are born from the amazement of the capability of the human brain.

                    <p>Based on my interests, my hobbies are rather predictable; Motorsports and reading.</p>
